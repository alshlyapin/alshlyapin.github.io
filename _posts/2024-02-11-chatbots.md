    - Only works in Microsoft Edge for me; no solution found yet
    - Executing a Python script for a mathematical expression sometimes results in incorrect output, e.g., `print(((345 * 0.566 / 0.42 + (1.2 + 2) / 2) * 111.2 / 0.33 * (234 - 123.2) / 456) * 0.583 / 0.115)`
    - However, running a complex Python script with functions yields correct output, e.g., generating prime numbers and checking if a number is a Fibonacci number.
